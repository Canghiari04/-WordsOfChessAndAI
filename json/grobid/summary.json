         "Abstract": "Theory of mind is the field devoted to understanding how organisms discern the mental states of others. Because mental states are not directly observable, they can only be inferred from observable features of the actor (such as behavior) and the situational context that the actor is in. Social psychologists, who study theory of mind processes under the rubric of attribution research, have shown that people often make a logical error of inference: The ``fundamental attribution error'' (FAE) is the tendency to assume that an actor's behavior and mental state correspond to a degree that is logically unwarranted by the situation. The social environment in which theory of mind capacities evolved may have influenced attributional processing in ways that could explain the error. In particular, the error could be caused by a psyche that is designed (1) to consider only those noncorresponding mental states (such as deception) that could have fitness consequences to the mind reader; (2) to bias inferences in a way that reduces the costs of erroneous inferences; or (3) to bias inferences in a way that yields reputational benefits. The existing literature is reviewed in light of these hypotheses."

TD learning is used to adjust the weights for evaluation features over the course of a series of games, starting from arbitrary initial values. For some games, to obtain weights accurate enough for high-performance play will require the TD learning phase to make use of minimax searches. A theoretical description of TD applied to minimax search is given, and we discuss how the theoretical characteristics of the method interact with practical considerations. These include the depth of search appropriate for successful learning and the use of self-play to enable the algorithm to be independent of human knowledge. We then report on experiments that obtained values for use in shogi-playing programs. Unlike chess, shogi has no generally agreed standardized set of values for pieces, so there is more need for machine learning. We compare our machine-learnt values, obtained without any human knowledge input, with hand-crafted values. TD learning was successful in obtaining values that performed well in matches against hand-crafted values."

         "Abstract": "This paper is the second in a two-part series on chess and clocks in the Book of the Duchess. In our first paper, \"Chess in Chaucer's Book of the Duchess,\" 1 we showed that Chaucer, in his elegy on the Duchess of Lancaster, carefully disqualifies the Black Knight's imaginative metaphor of chess as a ludic signifier of the process of love and life under the dominance of Fortune, and constructs his own metaphorical reading of the game. Where the Knight had read the fers as a female in need of the protection of the chess king, himself, the poet-audience of his lament, reads the fers more properly as a counsellor (Persian farzan, Latin farcia, French fierce); and, whereas the grieving knight declares he can no longer play the game once his fers is away (665-66), the poet correctly points out that the knight's despair is exaggerated (640-41); for in the game of chess, any pawn can be promoted to a queen. In the course of his inquisition, the poet, playing poun errant, promotes himself, effectively, to a counsellor. 2 We will argue in the pages that follow that the reshaping of the knight's metaphor is the first part of a remedia for his loss. The second part is figured, not as an invention, but by the happenstance of the castle bell sounding that ends both hunt and dream, and which wakes the poet to the composition of the poem which is the terminal portion of a tiered consolation for the Duke of Lancaster's loss. The bell figures time which heals all wounds, and the timing of the bell strokes follows fast upon the closing of the dialogue with the poetdreamer's terse response to the Knight's flat statement of his duchess's death that closes the force of his misconstrued metaphor. At this moment, the hunters' horns blow the end of hart-hunt; and, as the dreamer's eye follows the knight-now erect and mobile after his prostrate posture in grief-up a hill toward a castle, his ear hears the tolling of the castle bell whose twelfth ring is the terminus ante quem of the event and the dream which contains it. The two metaphors, chess and bell, operate as paired foci that have time and wisdom as coordinate remedies for the loss of a loved one caused by the accident of Fortune."

The reader should be forewarned: it is a personal view, therefore it bears a large dose of unavoidable subjectivity. The Pawns are the crest which separates the East from the West in Chess ludic structure. The basic idea is that an eastern form of Chess was developed from the Liubo material and that several elements were later borrowed by Persians or Indians to complete their own form of harmless battle game, from an existing substrate fertilised by a stable Hellenistic influence and Roman contacts. In this process, I fully agree with Averbakh who affirmed that the history of chess cannot be studied without a proper knowledge of the history of other board games 1. Meanwhile, most of similarities and differences between the Chinese and the old Indo-Persian forms are given attempts of explanation."

Although the two types of chess have the same number of pieces, similar individual characteristics for pieces, and comparable scales of the size of the boards, the fundamental differences in their playing rules lead to different construction schemes and results of endgame databases. In this paper, we describe our approach to the construction of Chinese Chess Endgame Databases when only one of the players possesses attacking piece(s). We show the results we have in constructing and analyzing a set of 151 endgame databases with a total of at most two attacking pieces, four defending pieces and two Kings. Our databases can be used by Chinese chess computer playing systems and computer aided Chinese chess training systems."

Given two equal lines of opposing Pawns, White on 3rd rank, Black on 5th, n adjacent files, White to play, at losing game, what is the result? It is understood that a capture must be made when possible. In terms of removing counters from piles, the rules may be described as follows: (1) a pile consisting of a single counter may be removed, (2) two counters may be removed from any pile, and (3) three counters may be removed from any pile and if desired that pile may be split into two parts. This game is a member of the class of octal games of Guy and Smith (1956)-specifically .137 in their notation. Under the rule that the last player to move wins, Guy and Smith show that the game has a remarkable analysis with a Grundy function eventually periodic of period 34."

As ICC expands in scope and scale, its segmentation strategies are analyzed as well as the impact of these extensions on its business strategy. The paper also discusses a novel method of data collection in an online community; the use of a participant/observer software agent to poll the community at regular intervals at collect data as well as promote a voluntary questionnaire as part of its service to the ICC community. Data collected by the agent in its first month of operation are analyzed and discussed."

         "Abstract": "In paired comparison experiments, the worth or merit of a unit is measured through comparisons against other units. When paired comparison outcomes are collected over time and the merits of the units may be changing, it is often convenient to assume the data follow a non-linear state-space model. Typical paired comparison state-space models that assume a \u00ae xed (unknown) autoregressive variance do not account for the possibility of sudden changes in the merits. This is a particular concern, for example, in modeling cognitive ability in human development; cognitive ability not only changes over time, but also can change abruptly. We explore a particular extension of conventional state-space models for paired comparison data that allows the state variance to vary stochastically. Models of this type have recently been developed and applied to modeling \u00ae nancial data, but can be seen to have applicability in modeling paired comparison data. A \u00ae ltering algorithm is also derived that can be used in place of likelihood-based computations when the number of objects being compared is large. Applications to National Football League game outcomes and chess game outcomes are presented."

         "Abstract": "Current interactive entertainment is not strategy-aware, in that it does not allow users to execute a wide range of real-world strategies in the context of the artificial environment, it does not recognize when users are trying to execute these strategies, and it does not include software opponents and partners that are capable of executing a varied range of strategies in response to user actions. A solution to this problem is to explicitly identify a broad range of real-world strategies that people would use if the environment of the interactive entertainment were real rather than fiction, to represent these strategies to identify their component features, and to design the entertainment environment so that these component features are supported and recognized. This paper gives an example of how the first two steps of this solution can be done in the political domain by examining 60 explicit strategies outlined in Machiavelli's The Prince."

This paper describes a project to collect and represent strategies on a large scale to identify the representational requirements of strategic planning in order to inform the design of future artificial intelligence planning systems. Three hundred and seventy-two strategies were collected from ten different planning domains. Each was represented at an abstract level and in a preformal manner designed to reveal the planning concepts that each strategy contains. The contents of these representations, consisting of nearly one thousand unique planning concepts, were then collected and organized into forty-eight groups that outline the representational and functional components of strategic planning systems."

         "Abstract": "All other things being equal, possessing a competitive edge over one's adversary in a given component of land warfare is usually thought to translate into improved combat effectiveness. A common assumption is that information is the critical component in which to achieve this. Little is known quantitatively about the robustness of the above two statements to variations in the level of battlefield uncertainty (the so-called fog of war). Recently, other researchers performed experiments using a modified version of chess to test these hypotheses. This paper outlines our attempt to repeat the chessboard experiments using another analogue of warfare based on a computer cellular automata model known as ISAAC. The benefits of doing this include the reduction in uncertainty and output variations by using less subjective players; the ability to obtain more accurate statistics from increased sampling; the capacity to consider more parameter excursions and scenarios, leading to further hypothesis testing; and importantly to test whether the chessboard conclusions are either model or scenario dependent."

The algorithms sculpted to create programs capable of beating some of the best humans in the world in games such as chess and backgammon provide the ability to analyze millions of possibilities, model opponent characteristics, and selfgenerate what-if scenarios. Unfortunately, the difference between the domain of information warfare and traditional game domains make application of some of these techniques challenging. In this paper, we identify the major challenges presented by the domain of information warfare, and how these challenges interact with traditional game theoretic techniques."

This note corrects a previous reference to a citation of it-and compares it with some statistics. After discussing 5-man positions, Beasley and Whitworth (1996) cite a commonly-held guideline: \"More complicated positions can usually be evaluated by ignoring like pieces.\" They did so after stating the caveat \"It is assumed that the position is 'typical': in other words, that both sides have organized their forces to reasonable advantage and that neither King is trapped against the side of the board\". Previously (Nalimov, Wirth and Haworth, 1999), I accidentally misquoted this excellent source, omitting both the 'usually' and the typical positions caveat. With fulsome apologies to Beasley and Whitworth for the displaced misquote, this note examines to what extent the guideline holds good."

         "Abstract": "This paper presents the results of a new self-play experiment in computer chess. It is the first such experiment ever to feature search depths beyond 9 plies and thousands of games for every single match. Overall, we executed 24,000 self-play games (3,000 per match) in one \"calibration\" match and seven \"depth X+1 \u21d4 X\" handicap matches at fixed iteration depths ranging from 5-12 plies. For the experiment to be realistic and independently repeatable, we relied on a state-of-the-art commercial contestant: Fritz 6, one of the strongest modern chess programs available. The main result of our new experiment is that it shows the existence of diminishing returns for additional search in computer chess selfplay by Fritz 6 with 95% statistical confidence. The average rating gain per search iteration shrinks by half from 169 ELO at 6 plies to 84 ELO at 12 plies. The diminishing returns manifest themselves by declining rates of won games and reversely increasing rates of drawn games for the deeper searching program versions. Their rates of lost games, however, remain quite steady for the whole depth range of 5-12 plies."

To examine the influence of cognitiveaffective molds, 53 beginner chess players, ages from 9 to 16 years old, enrolled in sport competitions, were assigned to two groups, high and low success. They responded to the MOLDES and the MEA tests, designed to evaluate individuals' molds. The results show that the more successful players used more realistic, positive, and moderated molds, facing reality, and coping with their failures and emotions appropriately, whereas the less successful players used evasive, imaginative, defensive, and inefficient molds."

         "Abstract": "Average raw scores on IQ tests have been rising for decades but it still is controversial whether population intelligence really is increasing. The present study looked at several real world indicators for evidence of a rise. First, the prevalence of mild mental retardation in the US population and elsewhere has been steadily declining for decades. Second, players in various intellectual games, particularly chess but to a lesser extent bridge and go, are reaching high performance levels at earlier and earlier ages. There are many more prodigies. Third, scienti\u00aec productivity, measured by number of journal articles and patents awarded, has risen greatly over the last few decades, even though much top intellectual talent may be shifting from science. Finally, I surveyed perceptions of teachers who had taught in high schools for over 20 years. Most reported perceiving that average general intelligence, ability to do school work, and literacy skills of school children had not risen since 1979 but most believed that childrens's practical ability had increased. Most reported perceiving a decline in students's motivation, which may be aecting their perceptions of general intelligence. All these trends have various possible causes other than rising intelligence. However, together, and with other recent empirical evidence, most indicators suggest population intelligence really could be rising."

         "Abstract": "A brief survey of psychological studies of chess I wrote this as a 3rd year term paper for my Human Information Processing class. The paper is presented in its original form although I may make odd minor corrections from time to time. Chess is an ancient game of skill. It is one of the few such popular games that is devoid of luck. As a result, it has been a popular choice of topic for psychological research, as it provides psychologists with insights into how humans think about problems. Chess has also been a very popular choice for artificial intelligence implentations, and the results have been very successful. For the first time last year, a computer program beat the world champion in a game with regulation time controls. The main question in psychological studies of chess is the following: how are better players able to win more often? Several factors have been investigated but there are no certain physiological advantages that always lead to better chess-playing. The most common finding of studies is that experience plays a great part in determining one's ability, which is certainly a promising thought for mediocre players. In essence, no chess gene has been found. This paper will provide an overview of psychological research into chess, with an emphasis on theories that have been proven inaccurate by future research, to show the development o research in this field. As with any other branch of psychology, theories are made, and then refined when conflicting experimental evidence becomes available."

A population of evaluation function candidates are randomly generated and exposed to the proposed learning techniques. An analysis to the success of learning is given and the undeveloped and developed players are examined through competition against a commercial chess program."

Independent of their spatial locations, objects of interest are depicted sharply in SDOF, whereas the context of the visualization is blurred. In this paper, we present a flexible model of SDOF which can be easily adopted to various types of applications. We discuss pros and cons of the new technique, give examples of application, and describe a fast prototype implementation of SDOF."

We investigate random minimaxing from a combinatorial point of view in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the utility of the minimax procedure and a theoretical justification for the results of Beal and Smith's experiments. The concept of domination is central to our theory. Intuitively, one move by white dominates another move when choosing the former move would give less choice for black when it is black's turn to move, and subsequently more choice for white when it is white's turn to move. We view domination as a measure of mobility and show that when one move dominates another then its probability of being chosen is higher. We then investigate when the probability of a \"good\" move relative to the probability of a \"bad\" move\" increases with the depth of search. We show that there exist situations when increased depth of search is \"beneficial\" but that this is not always the case. Under the assumption that each move is either \"good\" or \"bad\", we are able to state sufficient conditions to ensure that increasing the depth of search increases the strength of play of random minimaxing. If the semantics of the game under consideration match these assumptions then it is fair to say that random minimaxing appears to follow a reasonably \"intelligent\" strategy.

We focus mainly on techniques that have not only withstood the test of time but also embody ideas that are still relevant in contemporary game-playing programs. Pseudo code is provided for a special formulation of the PVS/ZWS alpha-beta search algorithm, as well for an implementation of the method of singular extensions. We provide some data from recent experiments with Abyss'99, an updated Chinese Chess program. We also pinpoint the current research in forward pruning, since this is where the greatest performance improvements are possible. The work closes with a short summary of the impact of computer chess work on Chinese Chess, Shogi and Go."

The main feature of ChessEdu is the use of representations of chess game histories, analysis and related annotations, which enhance the guidance of the teaching process. ChessEdu game histories play an important role from the didactic point of view, since they allow tutors to review what students have done and to guide their work. Annotations to the histories also allow tutors to include links to simplified positions. In this way, students learn chess by working on simple examples related to their previous wrong decisions in their game. ChessEdu is the first step in the definition of a framework to simplify the development of guided collaborative tutoring applications in a much broader context. 1."

All these high-performance game-playing programs use global search methods, which evaluate complete game positions. Local search is an alternative approach that works well in the case where a game state can be partitioned into independent subgames. The method of decomposition search [M. M uller, in: IJCAI-99, 1999, p. 578] can solve such games by a combination of local combinatorial game search with evaluation techniques from combinatorial game theory. We compare local and global search in endgame problems in the game of Go, which has been traditionally regarded as beyond the range of exact search-based solution methods. An endgame solver based on decomposition search can solve problems with solution lengths exceeding 60 moves."

Using a combination of the gaze-contingent window paradigm and the change blindness flicker paradigm, we documented dramatically larger visual spans for experts while processing structured, but not random, chess positions. In addition, in a checkdetection task, a minimized 3 \u00d7 3 chessboard containing a King and potentially checking pieces was displayed. In this task, experts made fewer fixations per trial than less-skilled players, and had a greater proportion of fixations between individual pieces, rather than on pieces. Our results provide strong evidence for a perceptual encoding advantage for experts attributable to chess experience, rather than to a general perceptual or memory superiority."

         "Abstract": "In this paper a number of principles for content-oriented cognitive psychology will be presented in the context of research into chess players' information processing. It will be argued that modern theoretical concepts of attention, imagery and memory are based on underlying concepts of capacity and format and that these concepts are not sufficiently powerful to express all phenomena associated with mental contents. Instead, one must develop a genuinely content-oriented theoretical language to discuss, for example, contents and their integration into thinking. The main problem is how to explain the contents of representations. Why do representations have precisely the contents that they have. Here the main attention will be focussed on the question how can one explain the selection of content elements in representations. To formulate the basic concepts of contentoriented thought research several issues must be discussed. Firstly, it will be shown that traditional attention and memory research is capacity-oriented and therefore unable to express mental contents. Secondly, it will be argued that there are content phenomena which must be explained by properties of other content phenomena. Thirdly, it will be shown that in chess, people integrate information into representations by using functional rules or reasons, i.e. concepts and rules, which tell why some information contents must be included in a representation. It will then be shown that people integrate information around learned 'thought models' whose contents, together with functional rules or reasons, explain and clarify the contentstructure of a mental representation. It will also be argued that the analysis of contents is metascientifically closer to linguistics with its basic method of explication and content analysis than natural sciences, which form the most common underlying model in current experimental psychology. Finally, content-oriented cognitive psychology and its presuppositions will be compared with neural and computational approaches to show that it gives an additional and alternative theoretical resource, but not a contradictory conceptual platform, to the previous theoretical ways of working with human thinking."

They spent fifteen minutes to half an hour a day teaching themselves these positions. As a result their skill in recalling chess positions rose from sixteen percent to somewhere between forty to fifty percent. The learning curve proved to have a shape which indicates that in the beginning learning is very fast but after some 100 \u00b1150 studied positions the speed of learning decreases substantially. A computer simulation was used to model the results and analyse alternative explanations. Two alternative ways of thinking were tested. In the first, chunk construction was assumed to be based on the neighbourhood of associated pieces. The second model assumed a frequencybased correlative association process. Although the learning curves of the two models are very similar in shape to those of the subjects, the frequency-based associative model gave a better explanation for the data. This is why it is natural to suggest that common co-occurrence in addition to easily recognizable chess-specific characteristics, like colour and type of pieces, guide associative processes during chess players' learning of chess-specific chunks."

Two types of effect of minimax are considered: (a) evaluation accuracy (are the minimax backed-up values more accurate than the heuristic values themselves?), and (b) decision accuracy (are moves played by deeper minimax search better than those by shallower search?). The experiments were performed in the KRK chess endgame and in randomly generated game trees. The results show that, counter-intuitively, evaluation accuracy may decline with search depth, whereas at the same time decision accuracy improves with depth. In the article, this is explained by the fact that minimax in combination with a noisy evaluation function introduces a bias into the backed-up evaluations, which masks the evaluation effectiveness of minimax, but this bias still permits decision accuracy to improve with depth. This observed behaviour of minimax in the KRK endgame is discussed in the light of previous studies of pathology in minimax. It is shown that explaining the behaviour of minimax in an actual chess endgame in terms of previously known results requires special care."

We make the realistic assumption that the players are boundedly rational: they base their actions on finite-order belief hierarchies. When the different layers of beliefs are independent of each other, we can retain Hars\u00e1nyi's type-space, and we can define straightforward generalizations of Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (bne) and Rationalizability in our context. Since neither of these concepts is quite satisfactory, we propose a hybrid concept, Mirage Equilibrium, providing us with a practical tool to work with inconsistent belief hierarchies. When the different layers of beliefs are correlated, we must enlarge the type-space to include the parametric beliefs. This presents us with the difficulty of the inherent openness of finite belief subspaces. Appealing to bounded rationality once more, we posit that the players believe that their opponent holds a belief hierarchy one layer shorter than they do and we provide alternative generalizations of bne and Rationalizability. Finally, we show that, when beliefs are degenerate point beliefs, the definition of Mirage Equilibrium coincides with that of the generalized bne."

         "Abstract": "Best-first search algorithms such as proof-number search work well when solving endgame positions in chess-like games. However, it is hard, even for proof-number (PN) search, to solve an endgame problem with very long sequences because of its inherent memory limits. After PN search was developed and had achieved many successes for solving some hard problems, innovations to depth-first search algorithms were based on the idea of proof numbers. This article introduces two such innovative algorithms: PN* and PDS. The PN* algorithm was developed for solving Tsume-Shogi problems, among which one with more than 1500 steps. Then, PDS was proposed to strengthen the power of the PN* algorithm. The current contribution presents an empirical comparison of PN*, PDS, and PN search, as well as some variants of depth-first search on the domains of 6x6 Othello and Tsume-Shogi. The comparison shows that PDS outperforms PN* on the two testbeds. In 6x6 Othello, the PN-search variant does not show its characteristic remarkable advantage over the usual depth-first search algorithms. In Tsume-Shogi, forcing move sequences and sudden terminations play an important part when solving such problems; therefore PN-search variants, in particular PDS, show the expected remarkable advantage over other depth-first searches."

The algorithm is based on proof-number (PN) search, a best-first search algorithm, proposed by Allis et al. [Artificial Intelligence 66 (1) (1994) 91-124], and on Korf's RBFS algorithm [Artificial Intelligence 62 (1) (1993) 41-78]. PN * combines several existing ideas. It transforms a best-first PN-search algorithm into an iterative-deepening depth-first approach. Moreover, it is enhanced by methods such as recursive iterative deepening, dynamic evaluation, efficient successor ordering, and pruning by dependency relations. The resulting algorithm turns out to be highly efficient as witnessed by the experimental results. The PN * algorithm is implemented in a tsume-shogi (Japanese-chess mating-problem) program, and evaluated by testing it on 295 notoriously difficult tsume-shogi problems (one problem has a depth of search of over 1500 plies). The experimental results are compared with those of other programs. The PN * program shows by far the best results, solving all problems but one. Needless to say, it outperforms the best human tsume-shogi problem solvers by far."

         "Abstract": "Retrograde analysis is an efficient exhaustive search method. It is a.powerfu1 tool that can be used in solving problems where end states have known values but starting states do not. It has been widely used to solve mathematically-precise games such as chess endgames, and is potentially usable in energy-minimization problems. With increasing computing power, both in speed and storage capacity, retrograde analysis will become more and more useful. This paper looks at successful applications to games, the challenges ahead, and the modifications that are required to utilize distributed hardware. The power and the usefulness of retrograde analysis are still limited by the computing resources one has access to. Today, the best sequential retrograde algorithms are capable of solving problems with about IO9 states in a few hours on a standard personal computer. Bigger problems need more powerful computers, or take much longer to solve, or are simply out of reach of today's technologies. Introducing parallelism to retrograde analysis is a natural way to attack the bigger problems. There are today three main architectures available for doing parallel retrograde analysis: namely Symmetric Multiprocessor systems, High-speed network based distributed systems, and Internet based distributed systems. In this paper, we discuss some of the key issues in doing parallel retrograde analysis on these different architectures. Technical challenges are addressed in detail, as well as some examples and proposals. These examples and proposals ure drawn from various board games, but the ideas can be applied to other problem domains."
