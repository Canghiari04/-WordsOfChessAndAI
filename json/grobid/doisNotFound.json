So, to punish it, she held it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was-\"and if you're not good directly,\" she added, \"I'll put you through into Looking-glass House. How would you like THAT? Now, if you'll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I'll tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there's the room you can see through the glass-that's just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way.\"-Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass (1871)"

         "Abstract": "This paper is the second in a two-part series on chess and clocks in the Book of the Duchess. In our first paper, \"Chess in Chaucer's Book of the Duchess,\" 1 we showed that Chaucer, in his elegy on the Duchess of Lancaster, carefully disqualifies the Black Knight's imaginative metaphor of chess as a ludic signifier of the process of love and life under the dominance of Fortune, and constructs his own metaphorical reading of the game. Where the Knight had read the fers as a female in need of the protection of the chess king, himself, the poet-audience of his lament, reads the fers more properly as a counsellor (Persian farzan, Latin farcia, French fierce); and, whereas the grieving knight declares he can no longer play the game once his fers is away (665-66), the poet correctly points out that the knight's despair is exaggerated (640-41); for in the game of chess, any pawn can be promoted to a queen. In the course of his inquisition, the poet, playing poun errant, promotes himself, effectively, to a counsellor. 2 We will argue in the pages that follow that the reshaping of the knight's metaphor is the first part of a remedia for his loss. The second part is figured, not as an invention, but by the happenstance of the castle bell sounding that ends both hunt and dream, and which wakes the poet to the composition of the poem which is the terminal portion of a tiered consolation for the Duke of Lancaster's loss. The bell figures time which heals all wounds, and the timing of the bell strokes follows fast upon the closing of the dialogue with the poetdreamer's terse response to the Knight's flat statement of his duchess's death that closes the force of his misconstrued metaphor. At this moment, the hunters' horns blow the end of hart-hunt; and, as the dreamer's eye follows the knight-now erect and mobile after his prostrate posture in grief-up a hill toward a castle, his ear hears the tolling of the castle bell whose twelfth ring is the terminus ante quem of the event and the dream which contains it. The two metaphors, chess and bell, operate as paired foci that have time and wisdom as coordinate remedies for the loss of a loved one caused by the accident of Fortune."

Unfortunately, most uncertain real-world problems are so complex that any progress in them is extremely difficult. Games model some elements of the real world, and offer a more controlled environment for exploring methods for dealing with uncertainty. Chess and chess-like games have long been used as a strategically complex testbed for general AI research, and we extend that tradition by introducing an imperfect information variant of chess with some useful properties such as the ability to scale the amount of uncertainty in the game. We discuss the complexity of this game which we call invisible chess, and present results outlining the basic values of invisible pieces in this game. We motivate and describe the implementation and application of two information-theoretic advisors that assist a player of invisible chess to control the uncertainty in the game. We describe our decision-theoretic approach to combining these informationtheoretic advisors with a basic strategic advisor. Finally we discuss promising preliminary results that we have obtained with these advisors."

The reader should be forewarned: it is a personal view, therefore it bears a large dose of unavoidable subjectivity. The Pawns are the crest which separates the East from the West in Chess ludic structure. The basic idea is that an eastern form of Chess was developed from the Liubo material and that several elements were later borrowed by Persians or Indians to complete their own form of harmless battle game, from an existing substrate fertilised by a stable Hellenistic influence and Roman contacts. In this process, I fully agree with Averbakh who affirmed that the history of chess cannot be studied without a proper knowledge of the history of other board games 1. Meanwhile, most of similarities and differences between the Chinese and the old Indo-Persian forms are given attempts of explanation."

We give a particular focus on the underlying qualities the ICC possesses in order to succeed and grow such as utilization of real-world credibility indicators (titles), a robust economic system, and mechanisms for user-contributed feature extensions. As ICC expands in scope and scale, its segmentation strategies are analyzed as well as the impact of these extensions on its business strategy. The paper also discusses a novel method of data collection in an online community; the use of a participant/observer software agent to poll the community at regular intervals at collect data as well as promote a voluntary questionnaire as part of its service to the ICC community. Data collected by the agent in its first month of operation are analyzed and discussed."

A solution to this problem is to explicitly identify a broad range of real-world strategies that people would use if the environment of the interactive entertainment were real rather than fiction, to represent these strategies to identify their component features, and to design the entertainment environment so that these component features are supported and recognized. This paper gives an example of how the first two steps of this solution can be done in the political domain by examining 60 explicit strategies outlined in Machiavelli's The Prince."

Three hundred and seventy-two strategies were collected from ten different planning domains. Each was represented at an abstract level and in a preformal manner designed to reveal the planning concepts that each strategy contains. The contents of these representations, consisting of nearly one thousand unique planning concepts, were then collected and organized into forty-eight groups that outline the representational and functional components of strategic planning systems."

A common assumption is that information is the critical component in which to achieve this. Little is known quantitatively about the robustness of the above two statements to variations in the level of battlefield uncertainty (the so-called fog of war). Recently, other researchers performed experiments using a modified version of chess to test these hypotheses. This paper outlines our attempt to repeat the chessboard experiments using another analogue of warfare based on a computer cellular automata model known as ISAAC. The benefits of doing this include the reduction in uncertainty and output variations by using less subjective players; the ability to obtain more accurate statistics from increased sampling; the capacity to consider more parameter excursions and scenarios, leading to further hypothesis testing; and importantly to test whether the chessboard conclusions are either model or scenario dependent."

However, it seems odd that such strategies could influence the success of chess players, because this game is usually considered to be influenced mainly by technical-intellective skills. To examine the influence of cognitiveaffective molds, 53 beginner chess players, ages from 9 to 16 years old, enrolled in sport competitions, were assigned to two groups, high and low success. They responded to the MOLDES and the MEA tests, designed to evaluate individuals' molds. The results show that the more successful players used more realistic, positive, and moderated molds, facing reality, and coping with their failures and emotions appropriately, whereas the less successful players used evasive, imaginative, defensive, and inefficient molds."

         "Abstract": "Best-first search algorithms such as proof-number search work well when solving endgame positions in chess-like games. However, it is hard, even for proof-number (PN) search, to solve an endgame problem with very long sequences because of its inherent memory limits. After PN search was developed and had achieved many successes for solving some hard problems, innovations to depth-first search algorithms were based on the idea of proof numbers. This article introduces two such innovative algorithms: PN* and PDS. The PN* algorithm was developed for solving Tsume-Shogi problems, among which one with more than 1500 steps. Then, PDS was proposed to strengthen the power of the PN* algorithm. The current contribution presents an empirical comparison of PN*, PDS, and PN search, as well as some variants of depth-first search on the domains of 6x6 Othello and Tsume-Shogi. The comparison shows that PDS outperforms PN* on the two testbeds. In 6x6 Othello, the PN-search variant does not show its characteristic remarkable advantage over the usual depth-first search algorithms. In Tsume-Shogi, forcing move sequences and sudden terminations play an important part when solving such problems; therefore PN-search variants, in particular PDS, show the expected remarkable advantage over other depth-first searches."

This study hypothesized that participants who first trained with such skeletal shapes would perform differently and better on a post-test. The study used an online game, CopyCat, involving rotating and stamping a 3D cube on a 2D pattern. Half the participants encountered occasional \"blanking levels\", where the cube turned white on all six sides at the first rotation, thereby eliminating any visual feedback on sequences of rotations. Preliminary results indicate undergraduate women benefited more from the blanking than did their male counterparts."
